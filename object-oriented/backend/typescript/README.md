# Quiz and Survey System - DDD Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a system that handles both quizzes and surveys following Domain-Driven Design principles. Both entities share similar structures but have different naming conventions for their question types:
- Quiz: textQuestion, singleQuestion
- Survey: text, single

## Domain Layer Tasks

### 1. Domain Model Updates
- [ ] Create shared QuestionType value object/enum
- [ ] Create shared Question interface/abstract class
- [ ] Implement Quiz aggregate root:
  - [ ] Quiz entity
  - [ ] QuizQuestion value object
  - [ ] QuizResponse aggregate
- [ ] Implement Survey aggregate root:
  - [ ] Survey entity
  - [ ] SurveyQuestion value object
  - [ ] SurveyResponse aggregate
- [ ] Define question type mappings:
  - [ ] Quiz: textQuestion → Survey: text
  - [ ] Quiz: singleQuestion → Survey: single
- [ ] Implement domain events for both entities:
  - [ ] QuizCreatedEvent
  - [ ] SurveyCreatedEvent
  - [ ] QuizResponseSubmittedEvent
  - [ ] SurveyResponseSubmittedEvent

### 2. Domain Services
- [ ] Create shared QuestionValidationService
- [ ] Create QuizCreationService
- [ ] Create SurveyCreationService
- [ ] Implement QuizResponseValidationService
- [ ] Implement SurveyResponseValidationService
- [ ] Define shared AnalyticsService for both entities

### 3. Domain Events
- [ ] Define shared event interfaces
- [ ] Create specific event handlers for both Quiz and Survey
- [ ] Implement event publishing system

## Application Layer Tasks

### 1. Use Cases
- [ ] Create shared QuestionUseCases
- [ ] Create QuizUseCases:
  - [ ] CreateQuiz
  - [ ] SubmitQuizResponse
  - [ ] GetQuizResults
- [ ] Create SurveyUseCases:
  - [ ] CreateSurvey
  - [ ] SubmitSurveyResponse
  - [ ] GetSurveyResults
- [ ] Implement command handlers for both entities

### 2. DTOs
- [ ] Create shared QuestionDTO
- [ ] Create QuizDTO and SurveyDTO
- [ ] Create QuizQuestionDTO and SurveyQuestionDTO
- [ ] Create QuizResponseDTO and SurveyResponseDTO
- [ ] Define request/response interfaces for both entities

## Infrastructure Layer Tasks

### 1. Repositories
- [ ] Create shared QuestionRepository interface
- [ ] Create QuizRepository interface
- [ ] Create SurveyRepository interface
- [ ] Implement respective repositories
- [ ] Create QuizResponseRepository
- [ ] Create SurveyResponseRepository
- [ ] Implement data persistence layer

### 2. External Services
- [ ] Implement shared analytics integration
- [ ] Set up notification system for both entities

```

### File Organization Guidelines

#### Core Layer
1. **Entities Directory**
   - Place all domain entities in `core/entities/`
   - Separate Quiz and Survey entities into their respective subdirectories
   - Each entity should have its own file (e.g., `Quiz.ts`, `Survey.ts`)
   - Include related aggregates in the same directory

2. **Values Directory**
   - Store all value objects in `core/values/`
   - Organize question types in `core/values/questions/`
   - Place shared value objects in `core/values/shared/`
   - Use clear naming conventions for value objects

3. **Logic Directory**
   - Implement domain services in `core/logic/`
   - Separate Quiz and Survey services into their respective subdirectories
   - Place shared services in `core/logic/shared/`
   - Include business rules and validation logic

#### Application Layer
1. **App Directory**
   - Keep application-specific code in `app/`
   - Maintain separate files for Quiz and Survey operations
   - Use clear naming conventions for application services

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use camelCase for methods and properties
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' (e.g., `IQuestion`)
- Suffix value objects with 'Value' (e.g., `QuestionTypeValue`)
- Use descriptive names that reflect the domain language

### Code Organization Principles
- Keep related code together in appropriate directories
- Maintain clear separation between Quiz and Survey implementations
- Use shared interfaces and utilities where appropriate
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Implement proper dependency injection

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Implement proper interfaces for all public APIs
- Use readonly properties where appropriate
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for domain modeling
- Use enums for fixed sets of values

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper authorization for both entities
- Secure response submission for both quizzes and surveys
- Protect results and analytics
- Implement role-based access control
- Use proper input validation

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize tasks
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with shared domain model implementation
4. Implement Quiz and Survey specific features
5. Progress through layers systematically
6. Implement testing alongside development
7. Perform thorough testing before deployment

## Notes
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document all changes in the codebase
- Consider performance implications for large datasets
- Plan for scalability in response handling
- Ensure proper separation of concerns between Quiz and Survey
- Create shared utilities where appropriate
- Consider future extensibility for new question types
